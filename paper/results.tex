\section{Results and Discussion}

\textcolor{red}{quality and timing comparison with previous methods, deal with closed surfaces by either starting from random rectangle embedding or basic heuristics like farthest points.}

\textcolor{red}{show improvements starting from results given by previous methods}

\textcolor{red}{how does triangulation affect our result? try same shape with different triangulation.}

\textcolor{red}{given a symmetric shape, whether symmetrically triangulated or not, does our method preserve symmetry in UV space?}
