\begin{itemize}
\item quality and timing comparison with previous methods, deal with closed surfaces by either starting from random rectangle embedding, basic heuristics like farthest points, or some learned prior
\item show improvements starting from results given by previous methods
\item how does triangulation affect our result? try same shape with different triangulation.
\item given a symmetric shape, whether symmetrically triangulated or not, does our method preserve symmetry in UV space?
\end{itemize}
