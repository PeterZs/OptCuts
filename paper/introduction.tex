\section{Introduction}

% our method is in demand in CG community
Mesh parameterization is an important problem in computer graphics research because it has many applications, e.g. texture mapping, remeshing, detail transfer, etc. It has been investigated a lot in the past two decades \cite{some mesh parameterization papers}. The quality of a UV map is usually measured as it's isometric property, i.e. area and angle preservation without inversions. Thus, discontinuities (seams) need to be introduced to help obtain maps with acceptable isometry. Previous works has been intensively focusing on the two steps separately, that is, where to place seams \cite{some seam placement papers}, and how to optimize for isometry (minimize distortion) with the seams provided \cite{some distortion minimization papers}. As the seam placement techniques are based on heuristics deduced from observation of the input shape, they are not robust to all inputs and usually leads to suboptimal results. 

We propose {\em OptCuts}, a joint discrete-continuous optimization framework that optimally and progressively introduce or remove seams in between distortion minimizations. We use a linear combination of symmetric Dirichlet energy~\cite{Smith2015Bijective} and seam length as objective, of which the stationary w.r.t. both UV topology and coordinates are guaranteed to be reached within a bounded number of alternating iterations per balancing factor, input model, and initial embedding. \minchen{[NOTE] (Here stationary w.r.t. UV topology is only in the approximation sense, because there might still be basic topological operations that could decrease the objective but end up not chosen because it's local evaluated energy decrease is not the largest one.)} Since in application scenarios, an upper bound for distortion is more intuitive than picking a balancing factor, we also provide a constrained optimization formulation that seeks stationary w.r.t. both primal (UV coordinates and topology) and dual (balancing factor) variables subject to user specified distortion upper bounds. \minchen{[NOTE] we don't consider bounds on seam length cause it's less intuitive?}

% main challenge
Seams, due to its discontinuous property, is not intuitive to be considered into traditional distortion minimization frameworks. What's more, in order for seams to be efficient, it needs to be sparse, which is another challenge for optimizing it with L2-type of distortion energies. The recently published AutoCuts~\cite{Poranne2017Autocuts} uses triangle soup data structure and model seams as a discontinous energy based on distance between corresponding edges, they jointly optimizes for symmetric Dirichlet energy and a smooth energy approximating their seam energy. They apply homotopy optimization to increase the accuracy of the approximation progressively in order to obtain sparse seams. We observed that initially placing seams on all of the edges introduces multiple times of redundant degree of freedoms since during their solving process, most of the triangles keep their relative positions w.r.t. to the neighbors. Besides, AutoCuts requires a certain amount of user guidance, e.g. parameter tuning, cut suggestion, patch movement, in order to obtain good results.

Based on our observations, we take the full mesh as starting point, and progressively place seams to help minimize distortion. We achieve this by proposing an optimization framework that alternates between discrete seam placement (in topology steps, Section~\ref{sec:topologyStep}) and continuous distortion minimization (in descent steps, Section~\ref{sec:descentStep}), so that we treat seam placement in a classic combinatoric way and also allow traditional distortion minimization methods to be directly adopted. In this way, we achieve a robust way to jointly optimize seams and distortion in a fully automatic manner while still allow users to communicate preferences on regional seam placement through edge weight painting.

% how we did it
Specifically, in descent steps, we minimize symmetric Dirichlet energy using projected Newton~\cite{Teran2005Robust} given the current UV topology. In topology steps, we search for a nearby UV topology that locally decrease the objective the most by querying a filtered set of basic topological operations including vertex split, edge merge, and triangle movement. To be appropriately aggressive on searching in the topological space, \minchen{[TODO] we develop an analogous line search method as in continuous settings and allow multiple fracture initiation.}

Our framework is parameter free to users, and we support upper bound control by solving a constrained optimization problem.

% framework
Seams created by our method are optimal for the distortion energy used. For conformal energy, it creates different set of seams that benefit conformality more. In addition, our framework has many potential extensions to support more important mesh parameterization features, e.g. global bijectivity, seamlessness, etc.

% experiment overview
We demonstrate our framework's capabilities by \minchen{[TODO] We also show that given a UV configuration by other methods, our method can improve the distortion and seam placement}

% contribution
Our overall contribution is a novel framework that jointly optimizes seam placement and distortion for mesh parameterization, which incorporated into a constrained optimization formulation could allow users to obtain output UV map with specified upper bound on distortion. Key to our method are the topology search and dual variable treatment that allows optimal cuts to be searched with bounded distortion. Moreover, our framework has the potential to handle bijectivity, seamlessness jointly within it as well.
