% context
Mesh parameterization is a critical task in computer graphics, with applications including texture mapping, remeshing, and detail transfer.  At its core, parameterization seeks to find a mapping from a surface---typically represented as a triangle mesh---into the plane.  To do so, parameterization tools must cope with intertwined challenges in topology and geometry:  A high-quality parameterization cuts a surface into simple %disk-shape 
patches so that each can be mapped into the plane with a reasonably small level of stretch or compression.

Given its broad applicability, it comes as no surprise that parameterization has been a focus of research in geometry processing.  Algorithms in this domain focus on two key aspects of the problem.  Particularly well-studied are \emph{geometric} techniques that assume a surface has already been cut into disk-topology pieces that each need to be mapped into the plane while maintaining fixed connectivity; at this point, parameterization becomes a real-valued optimization problem to preserve angles and areas while maintaining local or global injectivity. Complementing these techniques, \emph{topological} algorithms find reasonable seams partitioning a surface into individual pieces that can be parameterized.  

With a few notable exceptions, previous work treats seam placement and fixed-topology mapping as separate steps in the parameterization pipeline.  This is a key drawback, as seam placement and complexity have strong bearing on the best \emph{possible} geometric parameterization of each patch.  Coupling these problems requires navigating between two extremes:  A zero-distortion but topologically complex parameterization maps every triangle into the plane independently, while a high-distortion but topologically simple mapping might only require puncturing a few points in the input surface.

% task and object
In this paper, we propose a parameterization method that couples topology and geometry named 
{\em OptCuts}.
OptCuts is 
a joint discrete-continuous optimization framework that progressively updates seam placement between distortion minimization steps to search for the best UV map. 
%
We measure the trade-off between topology and geometry by balancing a distortion measure of choice, e.g.\ the symmetric Dirichlet energy~\cite{Smith2015Bijective}, with normalized seam length, reaching a parameterization that is near-stationary with respect to both seam placement and coordinate positions within a bounded number of iterations.

% self-weighting

Measuring a balance between distortion and seam length has previously required a choice of a relative scaling factor between these two objectives.  From a practical perspective, it is difficult for users to choose such a coefficient. %trading off between the two.

We propose to find locally minimal seam length for a user-specified distortion bound. Setting distortion bounds as a hard constraint guarantees a level of geometric quality, while simultaneously enabling the exploration of optimal seams satisfying the bound. %In turn, o %<--- not sure what ``in turn'' means in this context

% challenge
In contrast to previous work building up a parameterization from disconnected triangle soup~\cite{Poranne2017Autocuts} or by cutting between points of maximal predicted distortion~\cite{Gu2002Geometry,Sheffer2002Seamster}, our constrained optimization method minimizes with seams combinatorially, directly extending real-valued distortion minimization to the regime where seams can be introduced and removed. As distortion is typically reduced by line search in UV coordinate space, we accompany this with a secondary search procedure in ``topology space:'' We alternate between reducing stretch and introducing potential topological changes based on the first-order reduction they would cause in the summed distortion and seam length terms of the objective. %in each topology search iteration we first find a search direction that locally decrease the objective the most (in topology step, Section~\ref{sec:topologyStep}); and then we conduct a newly derived forward-tracking line search scheme alternated with distortion minimization iterations to decide the step-size (in descent step, Section~\ref{sec:descentStep}).% too much detail for intro


% experiments
\justin{the same 3 cites are repeated several times in the intro, not sure if it's worth maybe reducing this a it to avoid an ``us vs them'' attitude}
We demonstrate our method's capabilities by comparing to AutoCuts~\cite{Poranne2017Autocuts} as well as typical classic seam cutting methods~\cite{Gu2002Geometry,Sheffer2002Seamster}. % (Section~\ref{sec:results}). 
Given the same initial UV map, we efficiently reach identical distortion bounds with shorter seam lengths. We test on large-scale inputs to demonstrate scalability, and we use inputs with same shape but different triangulation to show that our method is stable to changes in mesh structure.
