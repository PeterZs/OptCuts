\section{Topology Steps for Discrete Optimization}

\subsection{Evaluating Topological Operations via Optimization on Local Stencils}

Candidate Filtering:
for each vertex
  compute divergence of local gradients
independently picking $\sqrt{n_{v,b}^i}$ boundary vertices and $\sqrt{n_{v,i}^i}$ interior vertices with largest divergence as candidates

Local Evaluation:
for each candidate vertex
  if on boundary
    for each interior incident edge
      split and compute $\Delta E_{SD,l}$ locally
      compute $\Delta E_{w,l} = (1 - \lambda_t) \Delta E_{SD,l} + \lambda_t \Delta E_{se}$
  else
    for each pair of incident edges forming a smooth path
      split and compute $\Delta E_{SD,l}$ locally
      compute $\Delta E_{w,l} = 0.5((1 - \lambda_t) \Delta E_{SD,l} + \lambda_t \Delta E_{se})$

split the vertex with largest $|\Delta E_{w,l}|$
turn on fracture propagation

Since we are using the local estimation to approximate true global energy decrease, it would be necessary to find a balance between accuracy and efficiency by weighing between size of local stencils and number of optimization iterations to run.

\subsection{Line Search in Topological Space}

Once a fracture is initiated, it almost always be extended further in the later topology steps, which justifies the robustness of our method. To speed up the process, instead of waiting for another descent step and query all the filtered candidates again, we propagate this newly initiated fracture further in between the first several inner iterations of the following descent step.

After the fracture has been initiated, we first go to descent step to run an inner iteration and record the energy decrease $\Delta E_w^j$ and energy $E_w^{j,0}$. Then we evaluate $\hat{f}_v$'s for splitting the tail vertex of the newly initiated fracture along its incident edges. If the one with largest $\hat{f}_v$ satisfies $\hat{f}_v - E_w^{j,0} \leq \Delta E_w^j$, we propagate the fracture along this edge, and run another inner iteration to do another propagation query. If there's no propagation that could benefit more than running the inner iteration, we stop query propagation in the current descent step and run inner iterations till convergence:

  for each fracture tail vertex $k$
    for each interior incident edge of $k$
      split and compute $\Delta E_{SD, l}$ locally
      compute $\Delta E_{w,l} = (1 - \lambda_t) \Delta E_{SD,l} + \lambda_t \Delta E_{se}$
  if the largest $|\Delta E_{w,l}|$ is larger than $|(1-\lambda_t)\Delta E_{SD}^j|$
    propagate fracture by splitting the vertex
  else
    turn off fracture propagation for the rest of the current descent step

\subsection{Multiple Fracture Initiation}
}
Multiple fracture initiation would be redundant on a single cone-like region since only one fracture would be enough to release the distortion. However, initiating one fracture for each cone-like region within a single topology step would certainly accelerate the whole process. 

This could be done by partitioning the UV space according to distortion or filtering measurement and initiate a valid fracture (if any) in each region in every topology step. The partition criteria could be separating the domain so that on each subdomain, the function is convex (has exactly one stationary).
