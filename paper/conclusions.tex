\section{Conclusions and Future Works}

multiple cut initiation in one topology step by global stretch analysis?

how to deal with closed surfaces (what will be the initial cuts for the initial embedding)?

try conformal energy like MIPS

bijectivity, seamless, and other augmentation of continuous energy?

handle user preferences on seam placement

seam smoothness, patch related discrete energy?

start and solve in 3D by reducing curvature so that the need for initial embedding could be eliminated, and the result is only "biased" by it's 3D shape, which is the most reasonable bias

taking advantage of parallelism to look both broader and deeper when searching in topological space, very useful for practical implementations

if the user won't mind getting a slightly different triangulation, we could also create fractures in the interior of an element and locally remesh the stencil

given a symmetric shape, whether symmetrically triangulated or not, does our method preserve symmetry in UV space?
